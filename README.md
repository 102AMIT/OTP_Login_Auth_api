Today, year 2020, passwords are widely used in our everyday life for many user authentications on the Internet. Primarily due to its convenience and simplicity, the use of passwords has been shown to be plagued by various security problems, especially in recent times. Password theft is becoming a common occurence and for this primary and security reason, many business companies and organisations are adopting alternative solutions. This is where one-time password (OTP) becomes really popular in recent times.

Password authentication with static password is particularly vulnerable as these passwords can easily be stolen by, for example, keyloggers, phishing attacks, trojans and etc, without owner's knowledge as well. This has led to the increasing popularity of One-Time Password (OTP) where the generated password is only valid for one login session. To do this securely and scalably, we are going to build a ReactJS app with OTP features using NODE MAILER And i also use JWt for authentication.
